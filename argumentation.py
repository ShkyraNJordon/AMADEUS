amadeus.logic - A Simple Logic
@author: Sh'kyra Jordon
------------------------------

This system assumes the same (simple) base logic (Besnard & Hunter 2014) and
    consistency with prolog syntax as logic.py (see preamble of logic.py).

This system also uses a notion of arguments, cases and "support" built on this
(simple logic) base logic:
    Argument:
        An argument is in the form:
            (support, claim)
        where:
            - claim is a literal.
            - support is a complete collection of supporting evidence (CCoSE)*
                for claim, and may consist of a combination of clauses and
                supporting rules from its KB.
    
    Case:
        A case is in the form:
            (supports, claim)
        where:
            - claim is a literal.
            - supports is a set of all CCoSEs for claim, as described above,
            
        Note: All arguments for a claim can be produced from a claim's case.
        
    (*) The notion of SUPPORTING a Literal or Rule, and what a COMPLETE
        collection of supporting EVIDENCE (CCoSE) for these items is:
    
        For a LITERAL:
            A SUPPORTED LITERAL:
                A Literal L is supported iff there exists in its KB at least
                one supporting clause or rule.
            A CCoSE FOR A SUPPORTED LITERAL:
                L is supported iff at least one complete collections of
                supporting evidence (CCoSE) for L exists and may consist of a
                combination of clauses and supporting rules from its KB.
                A CCoSE for L is a set of clauses and supporting rules that
                contains either:
                    - A clause in the KB that supports L.
                    - A supported rule R in the KB that supports L, with the
                        addition of the contents of a CCoSE for R.
            SUPPORTING CLAUSES AND RULES OF A LITERAL:
                - A clause C in a KB supports a Literal L if L is one of the
                    literals C asserts.
                - A rule R in a KB supports a literal L if L i its consequent,
                    and R itself is supported.
        
        For a RULE:
            A SUPPORTED RULE:
                A rule R is supported iff its antecedent contains only
                supported Literals.
            A CCoSE FOR A SUPPORTED RULE:
                R is supported iff at least one CCoSE for R exists and may
                consist of a combination of clauses and supporting rules from
                its KB.
                A CCoSE for R is a set of clauses and supporting rules that
                contain:
                    - Any union of exactly one CCoSE per antecedent literal of
                        R.
            SUPPORTING LITERALS OF A RULE:
                - A literal L may contribute to the support of a rule R if L is
                    in R's antecedent, and L itself is supported.
                - A combination of literals {L} support R if every literal in
                    R's antecedent is in {L}, and each such literal is itself
                    supported.
                    - Further, {L} minimally supports R if there are no
                        literals in {L} that are not in the antecedent of R.
