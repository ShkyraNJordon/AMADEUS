    "## What is AMADEUS?\n",
    "\n",
    "AMADEUS is a Python 3 based system that aims to serve decision makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "__AMADEUS seeks to aid decision makers in dealing with the contentious nature of inconsistent knowledge bases__:\n",
    "Any knowledge base that represents real-world information is bound to contain inconsistencies, and thus from this knowledge base, conflicting arguments are inferred. How we deal with these conflicts is ultimately up to a decision maker, but we can create systems to aid this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the report, a process is detailed that\n",
    "* takes a knowledge base of __logical statements__,\n",
    "* yields from them all the (infallible) __deductive arguments__ that can be inferred,\n",
    "* identifies the __conflicts__ within these arguments and thus any counters to every argument, \n",
    "* thus producing all the components necessary to create an __argument graph__ of these attacks, which can be passed to third party systems to yield __Dung's extensions__; sets of collectively acceptable arguments that satisfy some condition of *acceptability*.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sets can be examined by a decision maker, and based on whatever criteria fits her purpose, she can use these extensions, and the nature of their contents, to __choose which arguments to accept__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AMADEUS's role in this solution\n",
    "\n",
    "AMADEUS plays a part in this process by providing the functionality to enable a user to __infer arguments__ from a knowledge base of *simple* logical statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can demonstrate how AMADEUS can be used with relative ease to __identify the conflicts__ within these arguments, and produce this information in a __common format__ so it can be passed to third party systems that can yield __Dung's extensions__ from it."
